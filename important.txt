If the terminal gives an error:
RuntimeError: The session is unavailable because no secret key was set.  Set the secret_key on the application to something unique and secret.
then it is necessary to generate the key in the following code:

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = ''
_____example____1_______
to do this, you should write in the terminal: 

python -c 'import os; print(os.urandom(16))'

then it will generate a code, for example:

b'Z\x864\x94\x8a\xf2\x92\x1c\xb1&\xda\xff\x84\xdfc\x8c'



For chesking your token:
1. Copy your token from browser (after the running file 'app.py' with new ['SECRET_KEY'])
2. Visit https://jwt.io/ for checking your token     
3. Paste your token from browser into field "Encoded" (at the https://jwt.io/ )
4. Into the field "Decoded" your can see "PAYLOAD:DATA" from the table below
5. Ok. And for finishing the process, your should to copy the secret key from your running file "app.py"
   and paste it into the field (on the https://jwt.io/ ) "VERIFY SIGNATURE" 
6. Your will see "Signature Verified" 
7. Unfortunately, file 'app.py' hasn't generated 'refresh token', for that reason, for generate and checking the new token,
   your should to wrire in terminal pywershell:      python -c 'import os; print(os.urandom(16))'      , then copy the secret key
   and paste into the line:  app.config['SECRET_KEY'] =   from the file app.py.
8. And repeat the actions from paragraph from point '1' to point '6'.
9. Ok, job well done !
